tmdrv is a tool to initialize the Thrustmaster TX racing wheel as a standard
HID device.

This allows the wheel to be used in operating systems which are not officially
supported (only tested on Linux). Initial release is very basic, but support could
possibly be added in the future for force feedback, other wheels, and more
functionality.

Requires that the USB device files are readable and writeable. Uses
python-libusb1 for hardware interaction and jscal for eliminating deadzones.
